#  BMI Calculator ðŸ§®

## Goal's Project ðŸŽ¯

The goal of this project is to learn more about Optionals, solidify my understanding of the MVC design pattern and to introduce the concept of Classes. Iâ€™ll learn about objects created from classes with instances of Structs. 

## What I create ðŸ§±

In this module, I have made a Body Mass Index calculator. Based on the userâ€™s weight and height it will calculate their body mass and give a piece of health advice. 

## What I learn ðŸ“–

* How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
* How to create classes and difference between classes and structs. 
* Pass by value vs. pass by reference. 
* Formatting Strings. 
* Color literals.
